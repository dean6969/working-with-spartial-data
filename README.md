# Working with spartial Data

As a Spatial Data Analyst, my role involved extensively working with spatial data, employing Python as the primary tool for data processing and analysis. I was tasked with handling, parsing, and extracting relevant information from various data formats such as XML and PDF files.

One significant part of my job was data crawling, where I meticulously gathered and structured real estate data from the website, "https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/". This process involved identifying, retrieving, and organizing spatial information from the site, which was crucial for subsequent data analysis and decision-making.

These tasks were fundamental in enabling the effective management and utilization of spatial data, subsequently aiding in achieving strategic company objectives and providing valuable insights.
